As such, I can visit my own exhibitions without any visitors knowing who I really am even if I stand a few steps away from them.

            <p>t is first of all about liberating Art from its usual alienators that museums or institutions can be. But it is also about freeing the Space Invaders from their video games TV screens and to bring them in our physical world. Everything started the day I decided to give a material appearance to pixelization through ceramic tiles. I first wanted to create a series of "canvases" but I soon realised that tiles were the perfect material to display these pieces directly on the walls. I then had the idea of deploying my creatures on the walls of Paris and soon after in cities around the globe. Each of these unique pieces become the fragment of a tentacular installation.</p>

            <p>Little by little, I organised a detailed process by which I explore international densely populated urban areas and "invade" them. Usually, I try to display 20 to 50 pieces per city, which is already a good score. Sometimes I happen to return several times in the same city, deploying different “invasion waves” as I like to call them. The goal is to increase my score by continuously and restlessly invading new spaces. "Anytime, Anywhere" is the philosophy…I try to evolve and reinvent myself at all time while leading a precise and serious aesthetic invasion project.</p>

            <p>I am surrounded by a small team in my studio, this is a very confidential operation. I know it is hard to believe but the space invaders project is the project of one single artist.
                There are other people in Paris or elsewhere, who following their own path, have started to install mosaics in the street of their cities.
                These totally independent initiatives are out of my control but it is nice to notice that in a certain way, I have started a movement.</p>

            <p>They have contacted me on several occasions but without really any prejudice. In a certain way, I work with them, not against them.
This said, my initial source of inspiration was the Space Invaders and a few other video games but I have rapidly developed new models and created totally original icons. My creatures are now quite detached from the four original Taito creatures. My universe is full of other references that complete my repertoire. For example, I recently created a Pink Panther, a Mona Lisa or a Peter Pan.
These new development have happened consistantly, throughout the years.</p>

            <p>Not always. Sometimes it even goes quite well as there are some police officers who recognise and enjoy my art.  Unfortunately, there are still cases where I am not welcomed. The owner of a gallery I worked with had to spend two weeks in jail being accused of supporting me. There are some countries where I cannot travel anymore as I maybe prosecuted.
Fortunately, this is only Art and I will not face the “death penalty” which would be the only sentence that would stop me from continuing my invasion project.</p>

            <p>I don’t have a message to deliver to the world and I am not openly political. The way I operate is per se already political as I intervene illegally for 99% of my installation.

I like the concept of decontextualizing art to bring it to the streets, to surprise everyday people, while constantly creating new pieces. This project, I hope, will leave a print not only on the streets but also on the minds.</p>

            <p>Lately, I have been facing this issue.  A large number of the pieces are removed, damaged or destroyed by individuals who seek to resell them. Given the type of tiles I use, to steal the work is impossible. These individuals by removing the mosaics destroy the piece and then have to buy ceramics to repair or recreate the work. They even try to add a patina to make it look vintage. They then try to sell these bad replicas! I have hard time believing that anyone would buy any unauthenticated mosaic tiles as people could simply go to home depot and do it by themselves …I can only hope that soon enough nobody will be tempted to buy or steal pieces in the streets and therefore that this nonsense and painful destruction will stop.</p>

It is not a very difficult assembly work and it is possible to find similar types of tiles I use.The second solution is to purchase an "invasion kit". It is a ready-to-use limited edition of a Space Invader. They are produced at the studio and sold in the Space Shop. It is at the same time a conceptual and functional object. Finally, for people who wants a unique art piece, they can seek for an Alias, which is the exact replica of the unique work in the street. There is one and only Alias for any past or present works present in the streets. Every Alias comes with a signed certificate of authenticity.
